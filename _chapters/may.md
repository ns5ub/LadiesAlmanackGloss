                <p class="card-text"> Patience Scalpel questions Musset and Doll Furious as to how they can enjoy being in a lesbian relationship. Nip and Tuck then direct Musset to Bounding Bess who they suspect may also be a lesbian. Upon seeing Bounding Bess and her state of being absorbed in historical precedents like Catherine of Russia, and Sappho, Musset and Nip give up on seducing her, but Tuck gives it a shot. Musset and Nip talk about how it was being a lesbian in the past. Tuck then returns, noting how she said nothing but facts. Musset declares Bounding Bess is a lost cause and others are a better use of their time.  </p>

                <p class="card-text"> It was much easier to accept being a lesbian at the time than it was when Barney was younger “'...in my day I was a Pioneer and a Menace, it was not then as it is now, chic and pointless to a degree, but as daring as a Crusade, for where now it leaves a woman talkative, so that we have not a Secret among us, then it left her in Tears and Trepidation. Then one had to lure them to the Breast, and now,' she said, 'You have to smack them, back and front to ween them at all! What joy has the missionary'” </p>

                <p class="card-text"> Bounding Bess’ real-life counterpart was Esther Murphy, who became a Lesbian after having many Husbands. However, as she married Gavin Arthur in 1935, she was likely not openly a lesbian at the time. "Arthur Family Papers" (PDF). Library of Congress. pp. 3–4.

                <p class="card-text"> Doll Furious was Dolly Wilde, a neice of Oscar Wilde whom she bore a striking resemblance to. She was one of Barney's main lovers in the 1920s to 1930s. She once even called Barney "Dame Musset" in reference to the Almanack. </p>
