                <h5 class="card-title">Summary</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> Over tea, Tilly-Tweed-In-Blood and Lady Buck-and-Balk discuss the politics of homosexuality. The women state that marriage between the same gender should be legalized. Evangeline Musset says that while women cannot marry each other, it does not mean that they cannot have deep relationships. Lady Buck-andBalk proclaims that this is not satisfactory.  </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Analysis</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> “Just because woman falls, in this Age, to Woman, does that mean that we are not to recognize Morals? What has England done to legalize these Passions? Nothing!” shows the discussion revolving around same sex marriage (pg. 91)

“Should she not be protected in some way, from Hazard, ever attending that which is illegal? And should One or the Other stray, ought there not to be a Law as binding upon her as upon another, that Alimony might be Collected; and that Straying be nipped in the Bud?” -divorce and compensation, why should lesbians not have this same courtesy?  </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Key</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> Tilly is based off of Radclyffe Hall and Lady Buck-and-Balk is based off of Lady Una Troubridge. It makes sense that Tilly is arguing for same sex marriage in this chapter because Radclyffe herself was an advocate for homosexuals. Hall was a poet and author, and includes lesbianism in her work. </p>
