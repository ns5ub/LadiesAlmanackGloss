                <p class="card-text"> The preface introduces Dame Evangeline Musset. It characterizes her as a lesbian, possibly transgender, who is bold and has quite the sexual prowess. The novel also makes clear that while she is a lesbian she does not hate men, being more surprised than happy upon the discovery of the practice of castration. Musset is also quite masculine as she is described as "...developed in the Womb of her most gentle Mother to be a Boy... she came forth an Inch or so less than this...".  </p>
