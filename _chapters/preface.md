                <h5 class="card-title">Analysis</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> Musset characterized as being quite masculine as she is described as "...developed in the Womb of her most gentle Mother to be a Boy... she came forth an Inch or so less than this...". While Barney and Musset definitively identify as women, it is interesting as there are some possiblle trans-gender interpretations.
                </p><p class="card-text">
                The novel also makes clear that while she is a lesbian she does not hate men, being more surprised than happy upon the discovery of the practice of castration from the line, "'Though never', said she, 'has that Greek Mystery occurred to me, which is known as the Dashing out of the Testicles, and all that goes with it!' Which is said to have happened to a Byzantine Baggage of the Trojan Period, more to her Surprise than her Pleasure."

                <p class="card-text"> The character of Dame Evangeline Musset is based on Natalie Clifford Barney. Barney was the owner of the Paris salon this book highlights. Barney inherited a large amount of wealth after the death of her father and around 50 years old at the time which the Ladies Almanack was written. Just as Musset, Barney was known to have acquired an astounding amount of female lovers and was quite open with her lesbianism. </p>
