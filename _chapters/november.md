Summary:

Dame Musset sets out through her neighborhood, encouraging woman willing to listen to choose what she calls wisdom over love. Musset was shied away by many but that did not stop her from going woman to woman, door to door, trying to speak to any woman she came across. Some listened while others refused to. At the end, Musset encounters an elderly woman that shares some wisdom with her, telling Musset that as you get older love and wisdom are both gone. Hearing this and liking what she heard, Musset sets out to head back the way she came.
