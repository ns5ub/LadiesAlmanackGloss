Basic Summary:

Dame Musset sets out through her neighborhood, encouraging woman willing to listen to choose what she calls wisdom over love. Musset was shied away by many but that did not stop her from going woman to woman, door to door, trying to speak to any woman she came across. Some listened while others refused to. At the end, Musset encounters an elderly woman that shares some wisdom with her, telling Musset that as you get older love and wisdom are both gone. Hearing this and liking what she heard, Musset sets out to head back the way she came.

Analysis:

It seems that the ages of 50 and 60 are considered important milestones by Barnes as February states:

"August

When fifty odd and a day she came upon that Wind that is labelled the second.

Septembre

When sixty some, she came to no Good as well as another."

Furthermore, Barnes states that "to Woman it comes when she has no cause for Children and no effect for Babes! Then is she wise!" This is said to happen at 50, which Musset also obtains said wisdom at, despite not having children. This seems to suggest menopause gives the wisdom, as 50 is around the average age when menopause begins.
