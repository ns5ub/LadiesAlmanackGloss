###January 

Basic Summary: January sees the introduction of Patience Scalpel who expresses her confusion and displeasure at the concept of lesbianism. Patience Scalpel is included in the Almanack for precisely the opposite reason of Dame Musset - she doesn’t understand women, and more particularly the lesbians around her. She expresses her discomfort of these women throughout the year - and declares that her daughters would marry as normal.


Analysis: This chapter presents Patience Scalpel as the odd one out in the cast of the Ladies Almanack. She is a representative of tradition and is the “token heterosexual” in the cast of lesbians. The book presents their lesbianism as the norm, and Scalpel as the odd woman out for not understanding sex and love in between two women. 


Character: Patience Scalpel is a representative of Mina Loy, a friend of Djuna Barnes who lived in the same Paris community with her husband.
