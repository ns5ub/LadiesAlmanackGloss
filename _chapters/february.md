                <p class="card-text">The chapter opens with Barnes laments on not being able to please her lover in a way that has not been done before. It then follows up with an account of Dame Musset’s sainthood by going month by month, detailing her exploits over the course of her life.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Analysis</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> The Saints Days are noting events of Musset's life, usually who or the frequency of those she bedded. This section seems to be a satire, presenting her sleeping with women as a saintly event worth reverence. This chapter primarily uses its symbology and religious references in the description of Musset’s sainthood - in fact, many of the metaphors are in describing her sexual exploits. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Key</h5>
                <p class="card-text"> “When well thirty, she, like all Men before her, made a Harlot a good Woman by making her Mistress.” … This event is an actual event from Barney’s life - she was known to have been involved with Liane de Pougy who was considered one of the most famous courtesans of her time. </p>
                <p class="card-text"> Otherwise, it's interesting to note that Barney was actively moving away from Christianity despite ironically being considered a Saint here. She has been described as a pagan, and more specifically practicing her own interpretation of “pagan-Hellenism”, a historical Greek religion, perhaps having some connection with the references to Zeus and Diane in this chapter. </p>
