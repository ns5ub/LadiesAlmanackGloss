Basic summary:

The image for April depicts a woman looking extremely somber while sitting on a stool. The chapter presents itself with, “Acute melancholy is noticeable in those who have gone a long Way into this Matter…” and then goes into explaining “stages”. These are the stages of a relationship. The first being giddiness and nervousness, the second being the actions and consequences of falling in love, and the third being the physical and emotional states of heartbreak. 

Analysis: 

1st stage “brief of Thought; cut of Concentration; a Tendency to hop, skip and jump, and to misplace the Eye at every single or several Manifestation of Girl in like Distemper” (pg. 101) -the development of a crush, nervousness, giddy, happiness, etc. 
2nd stage “from six to eight weeks, to a Sobriety that includes thoughts of Transmigigration, Levitation, Myopia, and Blight. The Eye trickles, the Breath is short, the Spleen is distended, and the Epiglottis rises and falls like the continual swallowing of the Heart” (pg. 102) -falling truly in love and out of the honeymoon stage, settling in with one another
3rd stage “Death Agony...resembled a burning Brandy, and so ran upon the Sufferer that she was seen to be re-entered in a burst of Smoke, and was thus, in less than a Second, a charred and glowing Ember.” (pg. 103) -heartbreak, gone through the wringer and come out a “charred and glowing Ember”
