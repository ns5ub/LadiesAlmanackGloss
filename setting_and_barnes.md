    <p class="card-text">Barnes wrote and distributed the Ladies Almanack in the subculture of the Paris salon. A salon is a gathering of a group of individuals by some host to exchange ideas. Barnes herself had moved to Paris with her lover Thelma - a trend followed by many other artistic personalities of the time, including Radcliffe Hall, Mina Loy, and most importantly, Natalie Clifford Barney. Barney was at the forefront of the particular salon, inviting her friends to her manor at 20 Rue Jacob where they could share their ideas and present their works. This group of friends largely consisted of notable writers of lesbian literature, and this heavily influences the novel. Each character in the Ladies Almanack has a real world counterpart who frequented the Barney’s salon. As the foreword surmises, the Almanack was originally privately written, illustrated, and distributed to the members of this salon. The book itself while not pornographic, the bawdy lesbian content would likely have not achieved larger production without Barnes’s writing being as hard to parse as it is.</p>
